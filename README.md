## Calendars 
All these calanders are of the public calendar type, so they can be subscribed to using the URL rather than needing to import them to your calendar application. Public subscriptions have the advantage of automatically staying up to date with any changes the author(s) make. For exmaple, towards the end of 2025 ai will add the dates for the 2026 trimesters. For exmaple I may need to fix an incorrect due date in a subject calendar. I've also exported these calendars as files so you may simply import them to upir favorite calender application, but they will not update automatically, that's up to you to take care of.
